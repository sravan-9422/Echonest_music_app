# ðŸŽ§ EchoNest Frontend

This folder contains the frontend layout and UI components for the EchoNest music discovery app. It's built using AI-generated React + Tailwind code via [V0.dev](https://v0.dev), and will later connect to Firebase for backend features.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

- `page.tsx`  
  Main layout file that assembles the homepage using imported components and defines routing structure.

- `echonest-homepage.tsx`  
  The homepage component including header, mood chips, playlist cards, and icons â€” styled for mobile use.

## ðŸš€ Goals 

- Build out the UI for Home, Discover, Playlists, and Journal screens  
- Host the frontend via Netlify or Vercel  
- Connect frontend to Firebase for user mood logging and artist uploads

This will evolve as more screens and logic are added.
